    <p><span>Nerd</span>. The one word to best describe myself. I strive to learn new things every day to grow as a person. Whether that be technology, science, medicine, engineering, or even gaming.</p>
    <p>I'm a <span>coffee addicted</span>, <span>sleep deprived</span>, and <span>competitive</span> person. The goal behind this website is to continue learning and share as much as I can down the paths of all things programming and design.</p>
    <p>While software engineering is the main focus of this blog, I'll also share glimpses of my passion for cooking and cycling. When not working on personal projects or a freelance gig, I work for my university as a rails developer. During my limited free time I usually go cycling, cook, and play pc games.</p> 
    <p>I rely on logic and common sense to guide me. Through these principles I'm able to solve problems effectively, which is why I have a passion for programming. There's something incredible about being presented with a challenge and fighting to overcome it. I guess its sort of a superhero complex.</p>
    <p>I'm effective at working on my own, setting my own goals and accomplishing them, but I also do well when part of a team. I've learned that some problems may require multiple perspectives to conquer, and that everyone brings different skills to the table.</p> 
    <p>If you're interested in hiring me, please checkout my resume and portfolio!</p>
    <p>Stick around and follow my journey!</p>
